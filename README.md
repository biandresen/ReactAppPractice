# React Movie Search App

This is a React-based movie search application built as a personal project to practice and improve my React skills. It is inspired by and based on the tutorial/project by Adrian Hajdin, available here: [https://github.com/adrianhajdin/react-movies](https://github.com/adrianhajdin/react-movies).
